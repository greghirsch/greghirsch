- 👋 Hi, I’m @greghirsch
- 👀 I’m interested in--huh. I--is that, uh. Well. I guess I care about, like, new experiences, you know, carpe diem? Sorry, no one's ever asked--I mean, I guess I'm interested in whatever people are interested in, man. I don't know.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, um, how to survive in the Roy-eat-Roy world of corporate malfeasance, as it were 🤪
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of dreams and schemes! I host something of a, uh, talking shop for renewal, I guess you could call it? It's at my place, and it's not, like, a /thing/, thing, it's casual, but we, uh--we talk, about, um. Change. Jacquerie, haha, not really. All welcome!
